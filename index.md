# Welcome
Welcome to my personal blog where I will share my experiences and insights about creating SharePoint Sites with Aderant's [Handshake Software](https://www.aderant.com/solutions-handshake).

I have been immersed in the Legal Technology field for over four decades, starting on July 28, 1986. My journey with Handshake Software began in its early days, around 2003. Over the years, I have worn many hats: a Handshake client, a third-party consultant, and even an employee at Aderant/Handshake. Through all these roles, my enthusiasm for Handshake has remained steadfastâ€”well, most days!

Although I am semi-retired now, I still enjoy doing challenging and fun things with Handshake Software.
