# Welcome
Welcome to my personal blog where I will share my experiences and insights about creating SharePoint Sites with Aderant's [Handshake Software](https://www.aderant.com/solutions-handshake).

I have been in the Legal Technology field for four decades. (Day 1 - July 28th, 1986) and I have been working with Handshake Software since its early days, around 2003.  During that time, I have been a Handshake client, a Handshake 3rd party consultant and an Aderant/Handshake employee. Regardless of the role, I have always a Handshake Fan (well, most days).

Although I am semi-retired now, I still enjoy doing challenging and fun things with Handshake Software.
