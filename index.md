# Welcome
Welcome to my personal blog where I will share my experiences and insights about creating SharePoint Sites with Aderant's <a href="https://www.aderant.com/solutions-handshake" target="_blank">Handshake Software</a>.

I have been in the Legal Technology field for four decades. (Day 1 - July 28th, 1986) and I have been working with Handshake Software since its early days, around 2003.  During that time, I have been a Handshake client, a third-party consultant and an employee - and always a Fan. (well, most days).

Although I am semi-retired now, I still enjoy doing challenging and fun things with Handshake Software.
