# Welcome
This is my personal blog where I will share things I've done and learned about SharePoint powered by Aderant's [Handshake Software](https://www.aderant.com/solutions-handshake/). 

I've been in the Legal Technology field for 40 years. (Day 1 - July 28th, 1986) and I've been working with Handshake Software since it's infancy, around 2003.  Along that journey I've been a Handshake client, 3rd party consultant and an employee - and always a Fan. (well, most days).

While today I am semi-retired, I am still motiviated to do complex and interesting things with Handshake Software.
